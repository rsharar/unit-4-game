# unit-4-game
Purpose:
Math game to practice addition

Game Directions:
Each crystal is assigned a random value between 1-12.

Randomly generated target score between 19-120 is created.

Clicking on a crystal increases the 'total score' value, indicating the value of the crystal (which is otherwise hidden to the user).

Goal is to reach the target score by clicking crystals to add and reach total.
